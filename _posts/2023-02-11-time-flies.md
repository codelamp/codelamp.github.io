This is just a short post in an attempt to get me back into the swing of things. Technically speaking I haven't stopped. For most of those six years I've been working at a Marketplace startup called Trouva. And that has given me a massive boost not only in what I can do technically, but also in furthering my understanding of this strange reality called "coding".

My day to day mostly focuses around working with Node.js and Mongo in production, and looking after a number of services in and around that tech stack.

And yes, I am still pushing forward my personal projects ðŸ˜‚. Some of which â€”Â _as you can see from my blog_ â€”Â were started back in 2007. But we won't go on about that... I have learned so much from attempting to build these systems, that the act of doing it alone has been worth it. I am definitely not giving up however.

In fact I am (yet again) nearing completion of my game environment system, after yet another full rewrite. A system that pulls together Pixi.js, Dom-like management, and Matter.js â€”Â along with a whole host of other brilliant facilities.

Hopefully I'll be posting about that soon. Wish me luck.
