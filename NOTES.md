There are many ways to enable syntax highlight in Jekyll:

For this one you'll need to enable syntax.css

    {% highlight javascript %}
    // Your code here
    {% endhighlight %}

For this one you'll need to make sure a syntax highlighter like rouge is enabled

    ```javascript
    // Your code here
    ```

For this one you'll need `highlight.pack.js`

    Or just plain old indent w/ js
